### Goal: Learn how to use the simulator with Apollo autonomous driving software

1. Setup Apollo
	
	* Should already have installed latest Nvidia drivers (above) before installing Simulator
		
	* Install Docker CE and Nvidia Docker as described in https://www.lgsvlsimulator.com/docs/apollo-master-instructions/
		
	* Clone the Apollo Repository

		```bash
		git clone https://github.com/ApolloAuto/apollo
		```

		* If you have problems with the latest changes in Apollo master, check our online instructions which include a link to the latest commit we've tested with on Apollo master: [https://www.lgsvlsimulator.com/docs/apollo-master-instructions/](https://www.lgsvlsimulator.com/docs/apollo-master-instructions/)
		
		* You could also try checking out a named branch such as `pre6`:

			```bash
			git checkout pre6
			```
   	
		* Alternatively you could try Apollo 5.0 [https://www.lgsvlsimulator.com/docs/apollo5-0-instructions/](https://www.lgsvlsimulator.com/docs/apollo5-0-instructions/)

	* Start and enter Apollo docker
	
		* Start the docker (DO NOT run it with `sudo`!)
		
			```bash
			./docker/scripts/dev_start.sh
			```
		
		* Enter the docker:
			
			```bash
			./docker/scripts/dev_into.sh
			```

		* Make sure `nvidia-smi` is working inside the docker
		
	* Build Apollo (one time operation)

	* Once inside the docker, build Apollo (optimized, not debug, with GPU support):
		
		```bash
		./apollo.sh build_opt_gpu
		```


2. Run Simulator alongside Apollo

  * Launch Cyber bridge

	  	```bash
	  	./scripts/bridge.sh
	  	```
  	
  * Start (resume) the LGSVL Simulator:

  	* Note this is LGSVL Simulator, downloaded from [LGSVLSimulator.com](LGSVLSimulator.com), version 2020.05
  	* Launch the executable and click on the button to open the web UI
  	* Click "Simulations" to view the available/configured simulations
  	* Click in `AVS Apollo master` simulation to select it (indicated by check mark)
  	* Click "Play" icon to begin simulation
  
  * Use `cyber_monitor` to view messages, and use `cyber_visualizer` to visualize them

3. Run Apollo modules

  * Start Dreamview

	    ```bash
	    ./scripts/bootstrap_lgsvl.sh
	    ```

  * Open Dreamview in a browser by navigating to: `localhost:8888`

  * Select correct "setup mode", "vehicle", and "map"

    * For setup mode: select `Mkz Lgsvl`;
    * For vehicle: select `Lincoln2017MKZ LGSVL`;
    * For map: select `Borregas Ave`

  * Open the **Module Controller** tap (on the left bar).

  * Enable **Localization**, **Transform**, **Perception**, **Traffic Light**, **Planning**, **Prediction**, **Routing**, and **Control** modules.

  * Navigate to the **Route Editing** tab.

  * Select a destination by clicking on a lane line and clicking **Submit Route**.


## 4. <a name="pythonapi">Automation and Python API</a>

### Goal: Learn how to control the simulator using the Python API

1. [Controlling environment using Python API](https://www.lgsvlsimulator.com/docs/python-api/)

2. [Quickstart](https://www.lgsvlsimulator.com/docs/python-api/#quickstart)

    * Select pythonapi (virtual environment)

    	* Check out [virtualenvwrapper](https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
    	* Create virtualenv with: ```mkvirtualenv -p python3 pythonapi```
    	* Activate with: ```workon pythonapi```

    * Download and Install Python API

    	```bash
    	cd ~
    	git clone https://github.com/lgsvl/PythonAPI.git
    	cd PythonAPI
    	pip3 install --user -e .
    	```

    	(Leave out `--user` if working in a python virtual environment)

    * Launch Simulator
    * Review "API Only" Simulation settings
    * Start "API Only" mode simulation

    	* "Open Browser..." changes to "API Ready!"

    * Let's try one of the quickstart scripts to confirm that everything is working:

    	```bash
    	./quickstart/05-ego-drive-in-circle.py
    	```
